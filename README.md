# ECG-project
prediction of the ECG heartbeat signal category.
The task is to predict the ECG heartbeat signal category, which comes from a platform where the ECG data records are recorded, only 1 column of heartbeat signal sequence, where each sample of the signal sequence is sampled at the same frequency and with equal length. The personal information of the patients is protected. 
To ensure fairness, 80,000 samples are selected as the training set which will be provided for model construction and validation. Another 20,000 samples will be provided for during the test set.

Evaluation Metrics
The probability of prediction of 4 different heartbeat signals needs to be calculated, and the predicted results are compared with the actual heartbeat category results to find the absolute value of the difference between the predicted probability and the true value (the smaller the better). The formula of the measure is as follows.
For a given signal, if the true value is [y_1,y_2,y_3,y_4] and the model predicts a probability value of [a_1,a_2,a_3,a_4], then the average metrics 〖abs〗_sum of the model is:
 
For example, if the heartbeat signal is 1 and encoded as [0,1,0,0], and the predicted probability of different heartbeat signal is [0.1,0.7,0.1,0.1], then 〖abs〗_sum of this prediction is:
Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) is use to predict the category of ECG heartbeat signals. 
Data Preparation
Collect and Preprocess Data
Dataset: Obtain a labeled ECG dataset, such as the MIT-BIH Arrhythmia Database.
Normalization: Normalize the ECG signals to ensure the data is on a consistent scale.
Segmentation: Segment the ECG signals into individual heartbeats. Each segment typically contains one heartbeat centered on the R-peak.
Labeling: Label each heartbeat segment according to the categories (e.g., normal, atrial fibrillation, premature ventricular contraction).
Feature Extraction (Optional)
Time-Domain Features: Extract features like mean, standard deviation, and amplitude.
Frequency-Domain Features: Apply Fourier Transform to obtain frequency components.
Wavelet Transform: Decompose the signal using wavelets to capture both time and frequency information.
2. CNN Model Design
Input Layer
Shape: The input shape should match the dimensions of your heartbeat segments (e.g., 1D array for 1D CNN, or 2D array if treating segments as images).
Convolutional Layers
Filters: Use multiple convolutional layers with increasing filters (e.g., 32, 64, 128).
Kernel Size: Choose appropriate kernel sizes (e.g., 3, 5) to capture features.
Activation: Apply ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit) activation function after each convolution.
Pooling Layers
Max Pooling: Use max pooling layers to reduce the dimensionality and retain important features.
Pooling Size: Common pooling sizes are 2 or 3.
Fully Connected Layers
Dense Layers: Flatten the output of the last convolutional layer and pass it through fully connected (dense) layers.
Activation: Use ReLU activation in hidden dense layers.
Output Layer
Softmax Activation: Use a softmax layer for multi-class classification to get probabilities for each category.
3. Model Training
Compilation
Loss Function: Use categorical cross-entropy for multi-class classification.
Optimizer: Adam optimizer is commonly used due to its efficiency and effectiveness.
Metrics: Accuracy is a common metric, but you can also track precision, recall, and F1-score.
Training Process
Batch Size: Choose an appropriate batch size (e.g., 32, 64).
Epochs: Train for a sufficient number of epochs (e.g., 50, 100) to ensure convergence.
Validation: Use a validation set to monitor the model's performance and avoid overfitting.
4. Model Evaluation
Performance Metrics
Confusion Matrix: Analyze the confusion matrix to understand the model's performance on each category.
ROC Curve: Plot ROC curves for each category to evaluate the model's discriminatory power.
Precision-Recall Curve: Plot precision-recall curves, especially useful in imbalanced datasets.
Testing
Test Set: Evaluate the model on an unseen test set to gauge its real-world performance.
Cross-Validation: Use k-fold cross-validation to ensure the model's robustness and generalizability.
